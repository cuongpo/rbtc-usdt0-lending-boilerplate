# RBTC/USDT0 Simple Lending Boilerplate

> **Goal:** a simple, runnable boilerplate that demonstrates how to:
> - Deposit **RBTC (native)** as collateral,
> - Borrow `USDT0 (ERC-20, 6 decimals)`,
> - Query prices via a simple **UmbrellaOracleAdapter** (mock),
> - Compute **health factor** — all in a few minutes.

## Features

-   **Smart Contracts**: A minimal lending pool where users can deposit RBTC as collateral and borrow a stablecoin (USDT0).
-   **Telegram Bot**: A Node.js bot that allows users to interact with the lending pool directly from Telegram with secure key management.
-   **Hardhat Environment**: A complete development environment for compiling, testing, and deploying the smart contracts.

⚠️ **Educational only. Not audited. Do NOT deploy to mainnet.**

---

## Quick Start (Smart Contracts Demo)

Test this example on Rootstock Replit [Here](https://replit.com/@rootstockDevX/Rootstock-Lending-Boilerplate)

1) **Install** (first run only):
```bash
npm install
```

2) **Run the end‑to‑end demo** (compiles + deploys locally + interacts):
```bash
npm run demo
```

You will see logs:
- Deployer & user addresses
- Deployed contract addresses (USDT0, Oracle, Pool)
- Account snapshots after **deposit**, **borrow**, **repay**, **withdraw**

Here's how it looks:

```bash

> On Hardhat, the "native RBTC" is just the local chain's native coin. The boilerplate treats it as RBTC for consistency.


## Deploy to Rootstock (optional)

1) Getting tRBTC

You can get tRBTC from the [Rootstock Faucet](https://faucet.rootstock.io/).  You would need at least `0.03 tRBTC` to cover deployment and transaction fees.

2) Configure Environment:

Copy `.env.example` → `.env`, and fill in the values:

```text
PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
RSK_TESTNET_RPC=https://public-node.testnet.rsk.co
RSK_MAINNET_RPC=https://public-node.rsk.co
```

3) Replace Mock USDT0 with Real Address:
- The deployment script (`scripts/demo-testnet.js`) currently deploys the `MockUSDT0.sol`. For real deployments, you must use the actual USDT0 token address on Rootstock Testnet (e.g., 0x779Ded0c9e1022225f8E0630b35a9b54bE713736).

To achieve this, you need to modify your deployment script (e.g., `scripts/demo-testnet.js`) to use the existing address instead of deploying the mock token.

It should look like this:

```js
  // --- ORIGINAL CODE (Mocks deployment) ---
  // const MockUSDT0 = await ethers.getContractFactory("MockUSDT0");
  // const usdt0 = await MockUSDT0.deploy(ethers.parseUnits("1000000", 6));
  // await usdt0.waitForDeployment();
  // const usdt0Addr = await usdt0.getAddress();
  // console.log(`USDT0 : ${usdt0Addr} decimals: ${await usdt0.decimals()}n`);

  // --- REPLACEMENT CODE (Real USDT0 address) ---
  // ⚠️ Replace this placeholder with the actual Testnet USDT0 address:
  const REAL_USDT0_ADDRESS = "0x779Ded0c9e1022225f8E0630b35a9b54bE713736"; 
  const usdt0Addr = REAL_USDT0_ADDRESS;
  console.log(`USDT0 Address Used: ${usdt0Addr}`);

  // Deploy Oracle and Pool using the REAL_USDT0_ADDRESS:
  const Oracle = await ethers.getContractFactory("UmbrellaOracleAdapter");
  const oracle = await Oracle.deploy();
  await oracle.waitForDeployment();

  const LendingPool = await ethers.getContractFactory("LendingPool");
  const pool = await LendingPool.deploy(usdt0Addr, await oracle.getAddress(), 7000);
  await pool.waitForDeployment();

```

Keep the oracle mapping: `address(0)` stands for native **RBTC**; `address(USDT0)` for USDT0.

4) Prices & Oracle Configuration:
- This boilerplate uses **UmbrellaOracleAdapter** with owner‑settable prices.
- For a real integration, replace it with a production oracle (e.g. APRO/RedStone/Umbrella) and keep the `IPriceOracle` interface.

Run the custom deployment:
`npx hardhat run --network rskTestnet scripts/demo-testnet.js`

Result:

```bash

```

\> If you get the error: `ProviderError: insufficient funds to pay for pending and new transactions`

- Note: Ensure to have sufficient tRBTC of at least `0.003 tRBTC` to cover deployment and transaction fees.

## Telegram Bot (Development Playground)

The Telegram bot allows you to run your own personal bot instance to interact with the lending pool. Each developer can create and run their own bot for testing and experimentation.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or higher)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
-   A Telegram account
-   Deployed smart contracts (LendingPool, USDT0) on Rootstock testnet

### Step 1: Create Your Telegram Bot

1. Open Telegram and search for [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
2. Send `/newbot` command
3. Follow the prompts to name your bot
4. **Save the bot token** you receive (looks like `123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz`)

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```text
# Telegram Bot Configuration
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token_here

# Network Configuration (use testnet for development)
RPC_URL=https://public-node.testnet.rsk.co
CHAIN_ID=31
NETWORK_NAME=Rootstock Testnet

# Contract Addresses (from your deployment)
LENDING_POOL_ADDRESS=0x_YOUR_DEPLOYED_LENDING_POOL_ADDRESS
USDT0_ADDRESS=0x_YOUR_DEPLOYED_USDT0_ADDRESS
```

### Step 3: Run the Bot

```bash
npm run bot
```

You should see:
```
✅ Configuration validated successfully
🤖 Telegram Bot started successfully!
📡 Connected to Rootstock Testnet
🏦 Lending Pool: 0x...
🔐 Secure wallet management enabled
✅ Bot is ready to accept commands!
💬 Start a chat with your bot and send /start
```

### Bot Commands

#### Wallet Management
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/createwallet <password>` | Create a new encrypted wallet |
| `/importkey <password> <private_key>` | Import an existing private key |
| `/unlock <password>` | Unlock your wallet for operations |
| `/lock` | Lock your wallet (clear session) |
| `/deletewallet <password>` | Permanently delete your wallet |
| `/myaddress` | Show your wallet address |

#### Information & Status
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/start` | Welcome message and instructions |
| `/help` | List all available commands |
| `/status` | View your complete account status |
| `/balance` | Check your RBTC collateral and USDT0 debt |
| `/health` | Check your health factor |
| `/wallet` | Check wallet balances (RBTC & USDT0) |
| `/info` | Show contract information |

#### Lending Operations

| `/withdraw <amount>` | Withdraw your RBTC collateral |
| `/borrow <amount>` | Borrow USDT0 against your collateral |
| `/repay <amount>` | Repay your USDT0 debt |

### 🔐 Security Features

The bot implements **secure private key management**:

- ✅ **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: Private keys are encrypted with strong encryption
- ✅ **Password Protection**: Keys are encrypted with user-provided passwords
- ✅ **No Plaintext Storage**: Private keys are never stored unencrypted
- ✅ **Session Management**: Automatic wallet locking after 30 minutes
- ✅ **Secure Storage**: Encrypted wallets stored on disk (not in memory)

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for detailed security documentation.

### Security Best Practices

1. **Use Strong Passwords**: At least 8 characters, longer is better
2. **Lock Your Wallet**: Use `/lock` when done with transactions
3. **Dedicated Wallet**: Use a separate wallet for bot interactions
4. **Never Share Credentials**: Never share your password with anyone
5. **Test on Testnet First**: Always test with testnet funds before using real assets

## Contracts Overview (minimal unit)

- **contracts/LendingPool.sol**
  Core logic to deposit native **rBTC**, borrow **USDT0**, check solvency with **LTV**, compute **health factor**.
  - `depositRBTC()` payable
  - `borrowUSDT0(amount)`
  - `repayUSDT0(amount)`
  - `withdrawRBTC(amount)`
  - `getAccountData(user)` returns collateral/debt in tokens + **USD** and **HF**

- **contracts/oracles/UmbrellaOracleAdapter.sol**  
  Simple, owner‑settable prices (USD with **18 decimals**). Replace this with a real oracle adapter later.

- **contracts/interfaces/IPriceOracle.sol**  
  Minimal interface: `getPrice(asset) → priceE18`

- **contracts/tokens/MockUSDT0.sol**  
  ERC‑20 with **6 decimals**, mintable. Used only for quick demos.

**Decimals & math**:
- Oracle returns **USD price with 18 decimals** for both assets.
- RBTC has **18 decimals**, USDT0 has **6 decimals**. The pool normalizes to **1e18** for USD math.

---

## Minimal Interaction Examples

- **Deposit** 0.01 rBTC:
```js
await pool.depositRBTC({ value: ethers.parseEther("0.01") });
```

- **Borrow** 400 USDT0:
```js
await pool.borrowUSDT0(ethers.parseUnits("400", 6));
```

- **Repay** 200 USDT0:
```js
await usdt0.approve(poolAddr, ethers.parseUnits("200", 6));
await pool.repayUSDT0(ethers.parseUnits("200", 6));
```

- **Withdraw** 0.002 rBTC (keeps HF ≥ 1):
```js
await pool.withdrawRBTC(ethers.parseEther("0.002"));
```

- **Set prices** in the mock adapter (owner only):
```js
await oracle.setBatch(
  [ethers.ZeroAddress, usdt0Addr],
  [ethers.parseUnits("65000", 18), ethers.parseUnits("1", 18)]
);
```

## Omitted features (to keep it simple)

- Interest accrual (no time‑based rates)
- aTokens/cTokens or interest‑bearing receipts
- Liquidations, close/liq factors
- Pause/role systems beyond `Ownable`
- Multiple collateral/borrow assets
- Real oracle wiring (we use a minimal mock adapter)

This boilerplate is meant as a **first step**, you can fork and extend into a full money market.
